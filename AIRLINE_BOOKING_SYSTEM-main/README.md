# **Airline Booking System**  

This project is a **backend system** for managing airline ticket bookings, designed using a **microservices architecture**. It is built with **Node.js and Express.js**, utilizing **MySQL with Sequelize ORM** for database management and **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging.  

## ** Microservices Overview**  

The system consists of independent **microservices**, each responsible for a specific functionality. This architecture enhances **scalability, maintainability, and performance**.  

### **üîπ Core Microservices**  

| Microservice | Description | Technology Stack |  
|-------------|------------|------------------|  
| **Authentication Service** | Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization. Uses JWT for secure authentication. | Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (MySQL), JWT |  
| **Booking Service** | Manages flight booking, modification, and cancellations. Processes RabbitMQ messages for reminders. | Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (MySQL), RabbitMQ |  
| **Flight Search Service** | Provides flight search functionality, filters flights by price, duration, and departure time. | Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (MySQL) |  
| **Notification & Reminder Service** | Sends **email notifications** and reminders for upcoming flights. Processes messages from RabbitMQ. | Node.js, Express.js, RabbitMQ |  
| **API Gateway** | Routes API requests, handles authentication, and directs traffic to relevant services. | Node.js, Express.js |

## **System Architecture**  

- **Microservices-Based** ‚Äì Each service runs independently, reducing failure impact.  
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Centralized entry point for all requests.  
- **RabbitMQ Messaging** ‚Äì Enables event-driven architecture for notifications.  
- **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì Secure authentication for user access control.  

### **üîπ Inter-Service Communication**  
- **RabbitMQ** handles background tasks and ensures reliable message processing.  
- **API Gateway** routes HTTP requests to appropriate services.

## **Running the Services Locally**  

To set up the project, follow the **setup instructions** in each repository.  

### ** Prerequisites**  
‚úîÔ∏è Install **Node.js** and **MySQL**  
‚úîÔ∏è Install **RabbitMQ** for message queueing  

### **Steps to Run the Services**  

**Clone each microservice repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dishal35/AuthorizationService.git
git clone https://github.com/dishal35/BookingService.git
git clone https://github.com/dishal35/FlightsAndSearchService.git
git clone https://github.com/dishal35/ReminderService-main.git
git clone https://github.com/dishal35/API_Gateway.git
```
**Navigate to each repository and install dependencies**  
```bash
cd <microservice-folder>
npm install
```
**Set up environment variables (`.env`)**  
Refer to the **`.env.example`** in each repository.  

**Start MySQL and RabbitMQ**  

**Run each service**  
```bash
npm start
```
Ensure all services are running **simultaneously** for proper inter-service communication.
